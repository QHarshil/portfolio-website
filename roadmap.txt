Each section below explains what files you’ll work on, the order you should develop them, and the purpose of each file.
1. Project Initialization & File Structure Setup

Goal: Set up a new Next.js project with TypeScript, initialize Git, configure CI/CD, and create the desired folder structure (with emphasis on using the App Router).

Steps:

    Initialize the Project:
    Run in PowerShell:

npx create-next-app@latest --typescript portfolio-website
cd portfolio-website

Initialize Git & Connect to Remote:

    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit: Create Next.js project with TypeScript"
    git remote add origin https://github.com/YourUsername/portfolio-website.git
    git push -u origin main

    File Structure Update:
    Use a PowerShell script (as provided previously) to create extra directories and placeholder files.
    Folders to create under src:
        app/ (for all routes using the App Router)
            about/
            projects/
            project/[id]/
            contact/
            api/contact/
        components/ (with subfolders like common/, ui/, etc.)
        context/
        hooks/
        graphql/ (if needed)
        styles/
        utils/
        views/ (optional)
        tests/ (with subfolders matching your component/page structure)

Tip: Verify using the tree command.
2. Global Styles & Theme Configuration
File: src/styles/globals.css

Purpose:

    Import Tailwind’s base, components, and utilities.
    Set up global resets and CSS variables for colors (light/dark mode), typography, etc.

Content Example:

/* src/styles/globals.css */
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

/* Global Variables */
:root {
  --background: #ffffff;
  --foreground: #171717;
}

/* Dark mode variables */
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  :root {
    --background: #0a0a0a;
    --foreground: #ededed;
  }
}

/* Global body styling */
body {
  background-color: var(--background);
  color: var(--foreground);
  font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif;
}

File: src/styles/theme.ts

(Optional but recommended for a design system)

Purpose:

    Define a theme object (colors, breakpoints, spacing) that can be used with styled components or in your context.

Content Example:

// src/styles/theme.ts
export const theme = {
  colors: {
    background: 'var(--background)',
    foreground: 'var(--foreground)',
    primary: '#0070f3',
    // add additional colors as needed
  },
  breakpoints: {
    mobile: '640px',
    tablet: '768px',
    desktop: '1024px',
  },
  // More design tokens can be added here
};

3. Root Layout & Metadata (App Router)
File: src/app/layout.tsx

Purpose:

    This is the root layout that wraps every page.
    It imports global CSS, sets up SEO metadata, integrates Google fonts (or other fonts), and wraps children with a ThemeProvider.

Order & Content:

    Import Global CSS & Fonts:
    Use Next.js’s built-in next/font/google to optimize font loading.
    Define Metadata:
    Use the Metadata type for SEO, Open Graph, etc.
    Wrap Children with ThemeProvider:
    Ensure the entire app has access to theme state.

Example Implementation:

// src/app/layout.tsx
/**
 * RootLayout Component
 *
 * This file defines the root layout using the Next.js App Router.
 * It imports global CSS, Google fonts, metadata, and wraps the application
 * in a ThemeProvider to manage dark/light mode.
 */

import type { Metadata } from "next";
import React from "react";
import { Geist, Geist_Mono } from "next/font/google";
import "../styles/globals.css"; // Global styles
import ThemeProvider from "../context/ThemeContext"; // Theme context provider

// Initialize Google Fonts with CSS custom properties
const geistSans = Geist({
  variable: "--font-geist-sans",
  subsets: ["latin"],
});

const geistMono = Geist_Mono({
  variable: "--font-geist-mono",
  subsets: ["latin"],
});

// Define global metadata for SEO and social sharing
export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: "Your Portfolio | Advanced Frontend Engineer",
  description:
    "A comprehensive portfolio showcasing advanced frontend skills and modern web technologies.",
  openGraph: {
    title: "Your Portfolio",
    description:
      "A comprehensive portfolio showcasing advanced frontend skills and modern web technologies.",
    url: "https://yourportfolio.com", // Replace with your URL
    siteName: "Your Portfolio",
    images: [
      {
        url: "https://yourportfolio.com/og-image.png",
        width: 1200,
        height: 630,
        alt: "Your Portfolio",
      },
    ],
    locale: "en_US",
    type: "website",
  },
};

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en" className={`${geistSans.variable} ${geistMono.variable}`}>
      <head>{/* Additional head tags can be inserted here */}</head>
      <body className="antialiased">
        <ThemeProvider>{children}</ThemeProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}

4. Theme Context & Custom Hooks
File: src/context/ThemeContext.tsx

Purpose:

    Create a React Context that holds the theme state (e.g., light or dark).
    Provide functions to toggle the theme.
    Persist theme choice (using localStorage).

Content Outline:

    Define a context and provider.
    Use React’s state and useEffect hooks for persistence.
    Add clear, concise inline comments.

File: src/hooks/useTheme.ts

Purpose:

    A custom hook that provides easy access to the theme context.
    Returns the current theme and toggling function.

File: src/hooks/useScroll.ts

Purpose:

    Track window scroll position for dynamic UI changes (like sticky headers or animations).

File: src/hooks/useDebounce.ts

Purpose:

    Debounce a value or function to prevent performance issues during rapid state changes.

Note: Develop these one by one with detailed comments and tests later.
5. Core Pages (Using the App Router)

Each page file is placed under src/app/ with nested folders for routes. Build simple versions first, then iterate with more functionality and advanced features.
5.1 Home Page

File: src/app/page.tsx

Purpose:

    Create an engaging hero section.
    Introduce yourself with a brief bio.
    Include call-to-action elements (e.g., buttons to view projects).

Implementation Tips:

    Use Tailwind CSS classes for layout.
    Integrate Framer Motion for subtle animations.

5.2 About Page

File: src/app/about/page.tsx

Purpose:

    Present your biography and professional background.
    Include an “About This Project” section that details your tech stack, design decisions, and challenges.
    Link to your resume and social profiles.

5.3 Projects Overview Page

File: src/app/projects/page.tsx

Purpose:

    Display a grid or masonry layout of your projects.
    Each project should have a card with an image, title, and a short description.
    Cards will later link to the detailed project page.

5.4 Dynamic Project Detail Page

File: src/app/project/[id]/page.tsx

Purpose:

    Dynamically render a detailed view for a project based on the URL parameter.
    Include demo videos/images, technical explanations, and case study details.
    Use Next.js’s dynamic routing API to extract parameters.

Example Starter Code:

// src/app/project/[id]/page.tsx
import { useParams } from "next/navigation";

export default function ProjectDetail() {
  const { id } = useParams();
  return (
    <main>
      <h1>Project Details for {id}</h1>
      {/* Detailed project content goes here */}
    </main>
  );
}

5.5 Contact Page

File: src/app/contact/page.tsx

Purpose:

    Build a contact form with fields for name, email, and message.
    Include client-side validation (using Formik/Yup or custom validation).
    Provide interactive feedback (loading spinners, success/error notifications).

5.6 API Endpoint for Contact Form

File: src/app/api/contact/route.ts

Purpose:

    Create a serverless endpoint that processes contact form submissions.
    Follow the App Router API conventions (export POST, etc.).
    Return JSON responses indicating success or failure.

Example Starter Code:

// src/app/api/contact/route.ts
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const data = await request.json();
  // Process contact form data (e.g., send an email)
  return NextResponse.json({ success: true, message: "Submission received" });
}

6. Reusable UI Components

Build these in the src/components/ folder and import them into your pages. This helps keep your code modular and maintainable.
Key Components:

    Header & Footer (e.g., src/components/common/Header.tsx & Footer.tsx):
        Navigation links (Home, About, Projects, Contact)
        Theme toggle button (using useTheme hook)
    Button Component:
    A customizable button that supports different variants (primary, secondary, etc.).
    Project Card Component:
    A card for displaying project summaries in the Projects Overview page.
    Modal/Alert Components:
    Optional components for detailed pop-ups or user notifications.

Each component should include industry-standard comments and be written in a modular, reusable way.
7. Advanced Features & Animations
Integrate Framer Motion:

    Add subtle animations to:
        Hero sections (e.g., fade in, slide)
        Hover effects on buttons or cards
        Page transitions

Responsive & Accessible Design:

    Ensure layouts work across mobile, tablet, and desktop.
    Add ARIA attributes and keyboard accessibility to interactive components.
    Optimize images using Next.js’s <Image> component.

8. Testing Setup
Unit & Integration Testing:

    Testing Framework:
    Use Jest and React Testing Library.
    File Organization:
    Create test files mirroring your component structure (e.g., tests/components/Header.test.tsx).

End-to-End Testing (Optional):

    E2E Framework:
    Use Cypress to simulate user flows (navigating pages, submitting the contact form).

9. CI/CD Pipeline & Deployment
CI/CD Setup:

    GitHub Actions Workflow:
    Create .github/workflows/ci.yml with steps to:
        Checkout code
        Set up Node.js
        Install dependencies
        Run linting (ESLint)
        Run tests (Jest)
        Build the project

Example Workflow (from previous instructions):

name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Setup Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '16'
      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm install
      - name: Run Lint
        run: npm run lint
      - name: Run Tests

      - name: Build
        run: npm run build

Deployment:

    Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel, Netlify, or another hosting platform.
    Ensure environment variables (if any) are set up in the hosting dashboard.
    Verify production build with:

    npm run build && npm start

10. Final Polish & Documentation
Polish UI/UX:

    Refine animations, micro-interactions, and responsive behavior.
    Optimize performance using code splitting and lazy loading.

Documentation:

    Update README.md with:
        An “About This Project” section
